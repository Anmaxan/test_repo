## test Repo


### Git's commands:
*status - shows the status of the repos(is all up to date or something is new/modified and needs to be discarded or updated)
*add - adds the chosen file to some kind of transfer zone, so then you'll be able to make comments about changes
*discard - all the changes of the file can be removed, like they have never been done(some kind of ctrl+z, but for all changes at once)
*commit - used after `add` to write comments about changes(use `init, feat, fix, refactor, docs` to divide the changes by their purpose)
*push - sends file/update to the repos on github(now it's not only on your machine, but also is on the server somewhere there)
*clone - gets a local copy of repos from github(get the link in the green button of repos on GitHub)
*restore --staged - if you want to do more changes in file, but it's already added, use this
